This project uses Tailwind CSS make sure to follow the best practices for using Tailwind CSS framework.

Components are stored into src/app/components folder
Pages are stored into src/app/pages/pageName folder

For each new component development task:

1. You will receive a Figma design image showing the expected component appearance
2. After implementing the component, use MCP Playwright to capture a screenshot of the actual rendered component in the browser
3. Use MCP Process Image to compare both images (Figma design vs actual implementation) for visual validation
4. Ensure the implementation matches the design specifications including layout, spacing, colors, typography, and responsive behavior
5. Make necessary adjustments if discrepancies are found between the design and implementation

For each task you need to use MCP Sequential Thinking
